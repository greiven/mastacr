                    I have many hobbies and interests outside of my work and family commitments. I enjoys playing soccer, working out, and playing the guitar. When I have time off, however, what I likes to do most is travel.I have been to several states in North America, many countries in Latin America, and also several in Europe. The best trip I was taken so far was in 2017 I traveled to Italy, Belgium, Germany, and England. It was a whirlwind adventure over 12 days complete with trains, busses, taxis, planes, subways, and lots of miles on foot. Experiencing new foods, seeing historic museums and ruins, listening to international foods, and making friends from around the world made this trip the best one yet.
